Welcome to Caves of Golorp, to my knowledge the only Prolog Roguelike game
in existence.  This is an alpha release.

The included binary is for my Linux system; no promises as to whether it'll
work, be virus-free, etc.  SWI-Prolog supposedly can compile for Windows as
well; I don't have a Windows system to test CoG on, but would be interested
to hear reports of whether you can get it to compile and run.  The Unix
version of SWI-Prolog should be compatible with any reasonably standard
non-Linux Unixish operating system (BSD, Solaris, whatever) but that also
hasn't been tested in the case of CoG.  I'd like to remove Linux
dependencies, so let me know if you find one; removing Unix dependencies
would be nice but is a lower priority.  Porting to some other Prolog may be
difficult because of reliance on nonstandard extensions like thread support.

The included Makefile requires SWI-Prolog 5.2, which is under relaxed LGPL
and is available on the Web.  You don't need that if you're going to run the
included binary; the binary is all you need to run the game.

Please note that NO VERSION OF SWI-PROLOG PRIOR TO 5.1.13 WILL WORK.  CoG
requires the multi-threading features of SWI-Prolog, which are default in
5.2 and not default in earlier versions, but even if you turn thread support
on, versions prior to 5.1.13 do not save the thread_local directive in
saved-states, causing CoG to fail when run from a compiled binary.  Don't
send me "bug" reports from compiling CoG on the wrong Prolog, especially if
you installed the wrong Prolog from a binary Debian package and nonetheless
refuse to run *my* binary.

When you run the program, it will dump debugging messages into a file called
threads.log in the current directory.

You will need an ANSI terminal at least 80x24, preferably with colour.  My
computer's default terminal emulator works fine except that its cursor is a
little ugly; the Linux text-mode 80x25 console with t.fnt looks really
spiffy.

Key commands accepted:

up,down,left,right arrows - move your character.  To attempt to attack a
    monster, "move" onto it.
q - quit
< - climb stairs to previous level
> - descend stairs to next level
meta-D - for those who are eager to explore deep levels.  teleports
         character to the down staircase.
ctrl-L - redraw screen
meta-T - show SWI-Prolog's list of current threads (debug info).  This may
         cause the program to crash, because it eat the thread return values
         (Prolog's fault, not mine)
meta-L - dump the current level into the log file threads.log

Character creation: has a help file which you should read.

About the dungeon: A lot of things aren't implemented.  There are monsters
you can fight, but not many kinds, and you have to use your bare hands.  The
only monsters you'll actually see are bear cubs and "persons" (human-like
creatures) because I'm still defining the attributes for the others.  Read
mtbl.pl for a glimpse of some of my ideas for future monsters.  There are a
lot of different kinds of levels, but you have to go deep to see them and
you probably won't survive that long unless you cheat.  Somewhere between
levels 5 and 14 there is an extra "up" staircase leading into the infinitely
tall Tower of Golorp, which is worth a visit because it has different
layouts and different monsters from the main dungeon.

There is some infrastructure in place for magic, special attacks, character
types other than "person/human", saving and restoring games, and so on.

The game is barely fast enough to be playable on my computer.  I'm working
on speeding it up a bit.
